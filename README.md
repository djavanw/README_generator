  ## Installation:
  This application requires a Node.js JavaScript runtime environment and the inquirer module in order to run.  A `.gitignore` file that includes `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` must be created in order to not track the `nodes_modules` or upload it to GitHub and this must be accomplished before installing any npm dependencies.  In addition, a `package.json` with the required dependencies must be included into the repository.  This must be created before installing any dependencies by running the following command: `npm init`.

***
  ## Usage:
  This application interacts with a user by asking a series of questions and then formulating the responses into a structured README.md file.  When the user responds to the questions, the responses will be assembled and formatted to make the file.  To start the application, the user must type the following: `node index.js`.
